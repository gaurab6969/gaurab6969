;Write an ALP to Find the  square of a number using look-up table.

.data
    number dw 7         ; Example number to find the square of (between 0 and 15)
    square dw 0         ; Variable to store the result (square of the number)
    squares db 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225

    mov ds, ax
    
    ; Load the number into BX
    mov bx, number
    
    ; Ensure the number is within the bounds (0 to 15)
    cmp bx, 15

    ; Store the result in the square variable
    mov square, ax
    
    ; Exit program

    ; For now, just exit
